    <h2>Top 3 Best Movies</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Fault in our stars</h3>
    <p>One of the most emotional films I've ever seen. Very touching and heartfelt.</p>
    <h3>Athadu</h3>
    <p>Drama, Action and Comdey filled movie staring Mahesh Babu and Trisha. What more does anybody want. Very intresting and good film. </p>
    <h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
    <p>This is the movie everyone should watch. Great making and the story tells everyone to live the life to its fullest rather than running after money.</p>
